# Option/Settings System - Roblox Portfolio Project







##  Overview

A comprehensive, polished settings menu system for Roblox games featuring smooth animations, persistent preferences, and performance optimization tools.






## Features



- Low Graphics Mode - Disables bloom, depth of field, sun rays, blur effects, and global shadows for potato computers.



- Texture Management - Dynamically removes textures to boost FPS on low-end devices.



- Chat Toggle - Hide chat functionality for parental control and streamers.



- Music Mute - Independently mutes background music while keeping UI sound effects active.



- Smooth Animations - Tween-based hover effects (1.01x scale) with click feedback. (2px press)



- ZIndex Management - Proper layer hierarchy ensuring menus always display correctly.



- Sound Feedback - Satisfying hover and click sounds for all interactive elements.





## Architecture



- **Client-Side**: LocalScripts handling UI animations, user input, and local preference toggles.


- **Server-Side**: (Optional) DataStore integration for saving player settings across sessions.



- **Performance**: Optimized descendant scanning with instance caching for texture management.



- **Data**: DataStore integration for player preferences.
